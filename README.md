# End Christmas

A tower-defense style game very much inspired by the classic Bloons TD. But
story is instead that you have to stop santa with the help of snowmen and
christmas trees.

This is a game that I and five other students made over three months in a
C++ class at university.

## Building

Graphics library SFML is needed. Just run make and game will build and run.
